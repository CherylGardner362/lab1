	<p>Hello Professor Krieglstein, my name is Cheryl Gardner and I am a sophomore here at Illinois Tech. I play on the soccer team and am super excited for you to be my professor again!!! I am looking forward to learning a bunch of new skills this year that I can apply when I get an internship or job. Sad this class will be all online, however with COVID-19 I think it is the safest thing to do.</p>
